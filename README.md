Implemented a integrated framework consisting of software for two servers a home server for each particular home and a utility server for a community
The servers codes were written in hadoop (JAVA) with multiple map-reduces to deliver the result for more than a million home data
The most optimized schedule was determined using simulated annealing algorithm running in the servers with the user provide details through mobile application
